I developed this project as part of my course assignment, and in this module, I created
class structures that represent database tables.  These classes will be used to load data from the database into memory for later works.
They can also be used as a foundation for the layered architecture I will build in the next modules of this project.

Technologies and tools used

MS Visual Studio 2017
MS SQL Server Management studio 2017
Win 10 OS
